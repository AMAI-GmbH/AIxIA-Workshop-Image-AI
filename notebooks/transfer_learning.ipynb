    "In this tutorial you will learn how to classify cats vs dogs images by using transfer learning from a pre-trained network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **pre-trained model** is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. You either use the pretrained model as it is, or use **transfer learning** to customize this model to a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind transfer learning is that if a model trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. You can then take advantage of these learned feature maps without having to start from scratch training a large model on a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will try two ways to customize a pretrained model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction**: Use the representations learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples. You simply add a new classifier, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that you can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You do not need to (re)train the entire model.  The base convolutional network already contains features that are generically useful for classifying pictures. However, the final, classification part of the pretrained model is specific to original classification task, and subsequently specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fine-Tuning**: Unfreezing a few of the top layers of a frozen model base and jointly training both the newly-added classifier layers and the last layers of the base model. This allows us to \"fine tune\" the higher-order feature representations in the base model in order to make them more relevant for the specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will follow the general machine learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine and understand the data\n",
    "2. Build an input pipeline, in this case using Keras `ImageDataGenerator`\n",
    "3. Compose our model\n",
    "  * Load in our pretrained base model (and pretrained weights)\n",
    "  * Stack our classification layers on top\n",
    "4. Train our model\n",
    "5. Evaluate model\n"

The training process will force the weights to be tuned from generic features maps to features associated specifically to our dataset.\n",

If you add a randomly initialized classifier on top of a pre-trained model and attempt to train all layers jointly, the magnitude of the gradient updates will be too large (due to the random weights from the classifier) and your pre-trained model will forget what it has learned.\n",

    "Also, you should try to fine-tune a small number of top layers rather than the whole MobileNet model. In most convolutional networks, the higher up a layer is, the more specialized it is. The first few layers learn very simple and generic features which generalize to almost all types of images. As you go higher up, the features are increasingly more specific to the dataset on which the model was trained. The goal of fine-tuning is to adapt these specialized features to work with the new dataset, rather than overwrite the generic learning."

    "* **Using a pre-trained model for feature extraction**:  When working with a small dataset, it is common to take advantage of features learned by a model trained on a larger dataset in the same domain. This is done by instantiating the pre-trained model and adding a fully-connected classifier on top. The pre-trained model is \"frozen\" and only the weights of the classifier get updated during training.\n",
    "In this case, the convolutional base extracted all the features associated with each image and you just trained a classifier that determines the image class given that set of extracted features.\n",

    "* **Fine-tuning a pre-trained model**: To further improve performance, one might want to repurpose the top-level layers of the pre-trained models to the new dataset via fine-tuning.\n",
    "In this case, you tuned your weights such that your model learned high-level features specific to the dataset. This technique is usually recommended when the training dataset is large and very similar to the original dataset that the pre-trained model was trained on.\n"
